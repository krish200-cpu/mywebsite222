            <h2>1. Privacy Policy & GDPR</h2>
            <p>FuneralMatch ("We") are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. We collect personal data (Name, Postcode, Deceased Details) solely for the purpose of connecting you with Funeral Directors. We do not sell your data to third-party marketing agencies. Under GDPR, you have the right to request deletion of your data at any time by contacting dpo@funeralmatch.com.</p>

            <h2>2. Terms of Service</h2>
            <p>By using FuneralMatch, you acknowledge that we are an intermediary platform. We vet directors for quality, but the final contract for funeral services is between you and the Funeral Director. FuneralMatch is not liable for the performance of the services provided by third-party directors.</p>

            <h2>3. Cookie Policy</h2>
            <p>We use essential cookies to maintain your session (e.g., keeping your arrangement details saved as you browse). We use analytical cookies (Google Analytics) to improve our service. You may disable non-essential cookies in your browser settings.</p>

            <h2>4. Fees & Payments</h2>
            <p>FuneralMatch is free for consumers. We charge Funeral Directors a referral commission or subscription fee. This does not affect the price you pay; our "Fair Price" guarantee ensures you do not pay more by booking through us.</p>
